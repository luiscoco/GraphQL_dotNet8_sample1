# My first sample with .NET8 GraphQL

For more info about GraphQL see (youtube video):



GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data

Unlike REST, which uses a fixed set of endpoints to fetch data, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need and to aggregate data from multiple sources with a single request

This can lead to more efficient network requests and a better development experience
